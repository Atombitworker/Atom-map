What is atommap?

Atommap is a metaverse project based on the atomicals protocol. Inspired by atomicals and bitmap, this project integrates the techniques and principles of bitmap with the bitworkc technology of atomicals. Atommap is a pioneering consensus standard, enabling users to declare and interact with unique digital entities in the Atomicals ecosystem. Through a just and decentralized procedure, Atommap transforms Atomicals space, granting users a fresh perspective of the metaverse.

How to mint atommap?

Example 1: Registering 0.atommap

First, visit the official GitHub page and download atommap_svg_final.zip. After decompressing, locate the 0.atommap.svg you wish to register.
Inscribe on the atomicals client or the engraving website.
Configure bitworkc to ab0 and initiate POW mining.

yarn cli mint-nft "C:\Users\0.atomap.svg" --satsbyte 15 --satsoutput 546 --bitworkc ab0

Ultimately, you'll receive the accredited 0.atommap.

Example 2: Registering 10.atommap

As in Example 1, visit the official GitHub page and download atommap_svg_final.zip. After decompressing, locate the 10.atommap.svg you wish to register.
Follow the same steps for inscription.
Configure bitworkc to ab10 and initiate POW mining.

yarn cli mint-nft "C:\Users\0.atomap.svg" --satsbyte 15 --satsoutput 546 --bitworkc ab10

Ultimately, you'll receive the accredited 10.atommap.

Example 3: Registering 999.atommap

As in Example 1, visit the official GitHub page and download atommap_svg_final.zip. After decompressing, locate the 999.atommap.svg you wish to register.
Follow the same steps for inscription.
Configure bitworkc to ab999 and initiate POW mining.

yarn cli mint-nft "C:\Users\0.atomap.svg" --satsbyte 15 --satsoutput 546 --bitworkc ab999

Ultimately, you'll receive the accredited 999.atommap.

Example 4: Registering 9999.atommap

As in Example 1, visit the official GitHub page and download atommap_svg_final.zip. After decompressing, locate the 9999.atommap.svg you wish to register.
Follow the same steps for inscription.
Configure bitworkc to ab9999 and initiate POW mining.

yarn cli mint-nft "C:\Users\0.atomap.svg" --satsbyte 15 --satsoutput 546 --bitworkc ab9999

Ultimately, you'll receive the accredited 9999.atommap.
Incorrect Examples:

Assuming the prefix number is x:

Without initiating bitworkc mining, x.atommap is invalid.
If bitworkc ab(x) is set differently from the number x.atommap, x.atommap is invalid.
If x isn't a pure number, x.atommap is invalid.
Only x being 0,1,11,111,1111,11111 is recognized. When x is 0001, 0011, 0111, etc., x.atommap is invalid.
What's the total quantity of atommap?

There's no ceiling for atommap. However, the bitworkc mining mechanism used by atommap will lead to progressively challenging outputs. Below is the estimated mining duration:

x=1-9: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 10 seconds
x=11-99: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 2.67 minutes
x=100-999: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 42.67 minutes
x=1000-9999: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 11.38 hours
x=10000-99999: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 7.59 days
x=100000-999999: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 4.05 months
x=1000000-9999999: bitworkc =abx takes approximately 5.39 years
Atomic Theory

Welcome to Atommap, a revolutionary metaverse standard founded on the Atomicals platform. Drawing from avant-garde theories and advanced mathematical models, Atommap introduces a novel approach to digital ownership in a decentralized context, redefining the Metaverse concept.

How Does Atommap Work?

Atommap uses the Atomicals platform to establish inscriptions and digital imprints, turning them into tangible facets of the metaverse. Integrated systems can interpret this data, granting Atommap owners privileges and access rights, marking the dawn of a new epoch in open-source innovation.

The Significance of Atomic Ownership

With Atommap, owning a slice of the Atomicals space is not merely symbolic - it has practical implications. Owners can label transactions, segment their space, and engage with a broader community, making their Atomicals a dynamic interaction hub in the metaverse.

The Origin and Importance of Atoms

Certain sectors within Atommap have historical and foundational significance, traceable to the Atomicals platform's nascent stages. Holding these segments is akin to preserving a chapter of digital history, rendering them coveted assets within the collective.

Constructing the Open Metaverse with Atommap

The vision of Atommap stretches beyond the present digital horizon. Funds from initial acquisitions will be channeled to enhance the Atommap standard, laying a foundation for universes erected on these varied digital territories. Our strategy encompasses the evolution of this standard and fostering collaborations with platforms eager to incorporate Atommap and innovate.

Embrace the New Wave

We cordially invite you to join this transformative journey, crafting an open, decentralized metaverse. Whether you're an architect, dreamer, or an enthusiast of the Atomicals platform, there's a place for you within the Atommap collective. Dive in now and be a pivotal force in shaping the metaverse of tomorrow.
